        They don't hide from a challenge, no win is ever a close call

        Sal is straightforward - a plain old pal
        <br />
        Everything requires just one try by 'ol Sal
        <br />
        Especially getting up in the morning
        <br />
        Because while others slumber, they go exploring

        Now meet Alex....<!--Anri then the second one after this, probably-->

        Alex has dysania - a hard time waking up
        <br />
        And it's not because he was at the club
        <br />
        He needs your help getting up each day
        <br />
        I promise, he won't get in your way
        <br />
        <br />
        Born in Acornia, the land of his people
        <br />
        To others, he's considered feeble
        <br />
        Simply because he gets left behind
        <br />
        Every morning, in his bed, confined
        <br />
        ...
        <br />
        <br />
        Help him change his narrative from helpless to proactive. <br />
        Get Alex through the morning and get some tasks done along the way...
        <br />then maybe you and Alex could be great, too, one day
        <br />
