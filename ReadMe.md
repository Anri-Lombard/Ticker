# Ticker
Rewarding good habits one tick at a time

# Project Description
## How does it work:
Ticker is a task rewarder that uses this process to encourage good habits:
1. You choose 3 tasks you'd like to perform
2. Select the appropriate intervals to perform it in
3. Start the timer
<br />
<br />
In addition to the encouragement, you'll have a companion "Alex" that suffers the loss of your failure, or gets rewarded for your success. It is up to you to make sure the latter happens consistently :D

## Tech used:
Ticker was built with Vue and SCSS

## Challenges and future features:
There was a limited time to work on Ticker and only one coder along with 3 idea-generating teammates, which made it difficult to make the best app.<br /> <br />
The main features that need to be added is:
1. A database connection for custom choices from the user.
2. A streak that displays how many days in a row the user was successful.
3. User authentication and personalization.
